**Goal: Enhance Application UI and User Experience**

Please refactor the frontend of the application to improve its user interface and overall user experience, focusing on the following areas:

**1. Modernize and Theme the Layout:**
*   Apply a consistent, modern SaaS-like theme using Chakra UI.
*   Utilize Chakra UI best practices for spacing (p, m props), color schemes (choose a primary and secondary color palette), and font sizes (use the built-edge scale).
*   Refactor existing layouts to leverage Chakra UI's Flex and Grid components for better structure and alignment.

**2. Improve Form and Input Styling:**
*   Update all input forms to use Chakra UI's FormControl, FormLabel, and Input components.
*   Ensure consistent and clean spacing within forms.
*   Style buttons using Chakra UI variants, specifically using `variant="solid"` for primary call-to-action buttons like "Analyze Deal".

**3. Enhance Information Clarity with Tooltips and Helper Text:**
*   Add tooltips or helper text (using Chakra UI's Tooltip or FormHelperText) to explain complex financial inputs and metrics, such as IRR, NOI, and DSCR.
*   Ensure the user onboarding process is intuitive and user-friendly, possibly by adding introductory text or guidance within the UI.

**4. Implement Robust Responsiveness:**
*   Ensure the application layout adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes, particularly for mobile devices.
*   Use Chakra UI's responsive props (e.g., `direction={{ base: 'column', md: 'row' }}`) and the `wrap` prop for Flex layouts where appropriate.
*   Adjust padding and margins for different screen sizes to maintain readability and visual appeal.

**5. Provide Clear Visual Feedback:**
*   Integrate a Chakra UI Spinner component to indicate loading states during asynchronous operations like file uploads or AI analysis.
*   Use Chakra UI's Alert or Toast components to provide clear and concise feedback to the user for success messages, errors, and warnings.

**6. Implement Modals for User Interaction:**
*   Introduce a Chakra UI Modal component for confirmations, summaries, or displaying additional information.

**Considerations:**

*   Prioritize changes that have the biggest impact on user experience.
*   Maintain code readability and component reusability.
*   Ensure that the changes do not negatively impact existing functionality.
